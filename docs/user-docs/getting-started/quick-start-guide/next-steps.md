# Next Steps

In our hello world example we touched upon some very basic and light Aurelia concepts. The most important of those is the view/view-model relationship. However, please note that you can write Aurelia applications in a wide variety of different ways, including custom elements without view-models.

It is highly recommended that you have a read through additional sections in the "Getting Started" section to become familiar with the templating syntax, building components with bindable properties, looping through collections and more.
