  For fans of configuration, the configured routing approach is for those who
  want to explicitly work with the router.

# Configured Routing

{% hint style="info" %}
`Please note that we currently have an interim router implementation and that some (minor) changes to application code might be required when the original router is added back in.`
{% endhint %}

If you prefer a more traditional approach to routing where you specify the routes through configuration and things work similarly to other routers you might have worked with \(including the Aurelia 1 router\), then configured routing might appeal to you.
